# Fuseline

Correlate **location data**, **browsing history**, and **app usage logs** into a unified UTC forensic timeline. Fuseline surfaces **proximity sessions** where those sources coincide in time, with full artifact provenance and a tamper-evident chain of custody.

Workflow: **Acquisition → Analysis → Validation → Report**

## Problem statement

> Correlate location data, browsing history, and app usage logs into a unified forensic timeline.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Chronological view of mobile activity across multiple artifact sources |
| **Stack** | Python, SQLite, optional Plaso import |
| **Approach** | Extract timestamps → normalize to UTC → correlate events → unified timeline |
| **Output** | Unified mobile forensic timeline with correlated sources |

---

## Features

**Acquisition**
- Case management with examiner metadata, a device timezone, and per-case SQLite storage
- Format detection by **content**, never by file name; upload several files at once
- SHA-256 hashing, duplicate detection, **read-only** evidence copies, integrity re-verification
- Rows that cannot be parsed are skipped **and counted** (with reasons), never silently dropped

**Analysis**
- Zoomable, pannable swimlane timeline (Location / Browsing / App usage) over a whole-case overview brush; handles tens of thousands of events by switching to density view when zoomed out
- Proximity sessions drawn as bands across the lanes, with a location track (offline, no map tiles), spread radius, and per-event provenance
- UTC or case-timezone display; every event records *how* its UTC time was derived (`absolute`, `offset`, or `assumed`)
- Configurable correlation window, minimum sources, and maximum session length

**Validation & reporting**
- Validation findings: coverage, skipped rows, assumed timezones, gaps, sources that never overlap in time, implausible dates
- Self-contained HTML report (inline SVG chart, no scripts), CSV and lossless JSON exports
- Append-only, hash-chained audit log; the HTML report includes the chain of custody

**Also**: light/dark themes, keyboard-accessible chart and tables, fonts bundled (no third-party requests), bundled sample evidence plus a 3-day, ~3,800-event generator.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navneetxdd/fuseline.git
cd fuseline
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 22.12+ (20.19+ is enough to run and build the UI; the test runner needs 22.12+)

### Development (API auto-reload + Vite UI)

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
.\scripts\run_dev.ps1
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
bash scripts/run_dev.sh
```

The script creates `.venv`, installs dependencies, seeds the sample evidence, installs the UI, and starts both servers. Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. (If port 5173 is busy Vite picks the next one; Fuseline accepts any loopback origin.)

<details>
<summary>Manual setup</summary>

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements-dev.txt     # Linux/macOS: .venv/bin/pip
python scripts\seed_demo.py                              # (sample evidence is already in the repo)
cd frontend; npm install; cd ..
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend
cd frontend; npm run dev
```

</details>

### Single process (build the UI once, serve everything from FastAPI)

```powershell
.\scripts\run_prod.ps1            # Windows;  -Port 9000 to change the port, -Rebuild to force a UI rebuild
```
```bash
bash scripts/run_prod.sh          # Linux/macOS; optional port argument, REBUILD=1 to force a UI rebuild
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build         # http://localhost:8000, data kept in the fuseline-data volume
```

The compose file publishes the port on loopback only: Fuseline has no login (see [Security](#security-model)).

## Application workflow

1. **Cases** — enter a case name, examiner and the **device timezone** (used only for timestamps that carry no timezone), then *Create & acquire*.
2. **Acquire** — drop evidence files (or *Load sample evidence*), or under **App usage** use *Detect device…* to pull live app-usage via project-local `adb` (`tools/platform-tools/`, installed by `scripts/ensure_platform_tools.py` / `run_dev`). Browsing and location still need uploaded files. *Verify integrity* re-hashes every stored copy and checks the audit chain.
3. **Timeline** — scroll to zoom, drag to pan (or drag the overview window); click a mark, a table row or a map point to inspect it. Click a proximity session to zoom to it and highlight its members on the chart and map. *Correlation…* changes how sessions are built.
4. **Report** — review validation findings, sessions and the chain of custody; export HTML, CSV or JSON.

### Recommended walkthrough

1. **Cases** → create a case → *Create & acquire*
2. **Acquire** → *Load sample evidence* (15 events, 4 artifacts, 4 proximity sessions) → *Verify integrity*
3. **Timeline** → click a session card → click a mark or a map point to inspect the event and its provenance
4. **Report** → export HTML (and optionally CSV / JSON); note the chain of custody at the end of the HTML report

Try it at scale: `python scripts/seed_demo.py --large` writes a three-day sample (~3,800 events) to `samples/large_demo/`; upload those three files into a case. The UI and API have been exercised with 60,000 events (ingest in a few seconds; each timeline query well under a second).

---

## Evidence formats

Formats are recognised from file **content** (SQLite schema, CSV header, XML/JSON structure). The *source hint* on the Acquire page only narrows which parsers are tried.

| Source | Formats |
|--------|---------|
| Browsing | Chromium / Chrome / Edge `History` (visits with decoded transition types, search terms, downloads); Firefox / Firefox for Android `places.sqlite` |
| App usage | Android UsageStats: SQLite (`events` + `packages`), ALEAPP-style CSV, UsageStats XML; event types decoded (foreground, background, screen on/off, …) |
| Location | CSV or SQLite with latitude / longitude / time columns; **GPX**; **Google Takeout** `Records.json` |
| Plaso (optional) | `psort` L2TCSV and JSON-lines output; honours the timezone declared per row; mapped onto the lanes above |

Not supported (export to one of the formats above first): raw UsageStats protobuf files, Chromium WAL sidecars (upload a checkpointed `History`), iOS databases.

Sample artifacts live in `samples/demo_case/` (regenerate with `python scripts/seed_demo.py`): `app_usage.db`, `History`, `location.csv`, `plaso_sample.l2t.csv` → 15 events, 4 artifacts, 4 proximity sessions.

### Plaso

Plaso is not required. To bring in a Plaso timeline:

```bash
log2timeline.py --storage-file evidence.plaso /path/to/extraction
psort.py -o l2tcsv -w timeline.l2t.csv evidence.plaso        # or: -o json_line
```

Upload the resulting file on Acquire.

## How it works

```
Acquire → hash → detect format → parse (skips counted) → normalise to UTC → SQLite events
                                                       → validation findings
                                                       → proximity sessions
UI / report exports ← FastAPI
```

### Time handling

Every event stores its UTC time, the original source value, and a **basis**:

| Basis | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `absolute` | Epoch numbers, or strings marked `Z`/UTC — exact |
| `offset` | Strings with an explicit offset (e.g. `-05:00`), converted |
| `assumed` | No timezone in the source; interpreted in the **case timezone** and flagged (`TZ_ASSUMED` finding) |

Confirm the device timezone before relying on cross-source ordering of `assumed` events.

### Proximity sessions

Events are sorted by UTC time and chained into a cluster while each is within the **window** (default 300 s) of the previous one. A cluster becomes a session when it contains at least **2 distinct sources**; clusters longer than the **maximum length** (default 30 min) are split at their widest pauses. Every event belongs to at most one session, results are independent of input order, and session IDs are deterministic. Score = distinct sources + 0.5 if a location source is present + min(1, events/10). Sessions show *temporal coincidence*, not causation.

### Integrity

- Uploads are hashed, copied, re-hashed, and the copy is made **read-only**.
- Event IDs are deterministic (`sha256(artifact) + row`), so re-ingesting the same evidence elsewhere reproduces the same IDs.
- The audit log chains each entry to the previous entry's hash. *Verify integrity* recomputes the chain and re-hashes the stored evidence.

## Security model

Fuseline is built for a **local examiner workstation**. It has no login, so anything that can reach the port can read and delete cases: keep it on loopback and do not expose it to a network. It is not multi-tenant hosting.

Because evidence is untrusted input and the API has no login, the following are enforced:

- **`Host` allow-list** (DNS-rebinding defence) and an **`Origin` check on state-changing requests** (cross-site form/`fetch` defence); CORS is not wildcard and never allows credentials.
- **HTML report**: all evidence strings are escaped, and the response carries `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` (no scripts). Titles and package names in evidence can be attacker-controlled.
- **CSV export** prefixes cells that would run as spreadsheet formulas; the JSON export is byte-faithful.
- **The UI never makes an evidence URL clickable** (they are shown defanged with a Copy button) and strips control / bidirectional-override characters from event titles.
- **Hostile files**: SQLite evidence is opened read-only and `immutable` with a query time budget and quoted identifiers; XML is parsed with `defusedxml` (entity bombs refused); uploads are size-capped, filenames sanitised, paths confined under the data directory.
- Security headers (`nosniff`, `no-referrer`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Cache-Control: no-store` on API responses); the UI's CSP forbids inline scripts and third-party origins.

Fuseline's parsers are a convenience for triage and correlation; corroborate significant findings with a second, validated forensic tool before relying on them.
